## This file describe how we use the time series (mood vector)

1. Provide a compact valence description of the dataset (2 months before participants reported CESD)
2. Demonstrate trends of positive and negative valence 60 days before participants reported CESD. To demonstrate the valence, it's good to know the magnitude of the valence by computing the proportion of dominant valence posts among all the posts,design 3 is more appropriate to this task.
3. Explain trend difference between high CES-D and low CES-D group.

4. observe relationship between valence and other variables:
	1. satisfaction with life (I would suggest to remove this because it's not directly related to depression, it might be confusing to the theme)
		observe trend difference between people with high and low satisfaction with life. Satisfaction with life is a relatively stable variable. Participant's valence should not change much according to time, except that they have high CES-D score. Hence, the frequency of having positive/negative emotion might be more informative to satisfaction with life.  Design 4 might be a good option for this task. 
	2. personality 
	neuroticism:  
	Rumination and worry, cognitive reactivity have been found to be mediators in the relationship between neuroticism and symptoms of depressin and anxiety. A mediator explains why there is a relationship between the two variables. Since neuroticism is directly linked to the behavior of rumination, worry and cognitive reactivity, hence neuroticism might have a stronger correlation with the mood vector than with depression. We can do correlation tests, divide participants with high/low scores in neuriticism and see their valence trend. 

	Similar to satisfaction with life, neuroticism is a relatively stable varible. However, the high CESD group should show more frequent negative valence as they probably shows more rumination and worry in the posts (this is a speculation, need futher study, but we should state our speculation on the paper), which contains negative emotion. Design 4 seem to be more appropriate to this task.

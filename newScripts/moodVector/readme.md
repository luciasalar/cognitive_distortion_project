# This folder contains everything about the mood vector:

* statsForMoodVec.Rmd: this script computes the stats for data that built the mood vector

* MoodVec_Design1.ipynb & MoodVec_Design2.ipynb: scripts that generated the mood vector

* moodVectorsData: pickle mood vectors 

* predictCESD.ipynb: using mood vector to predict CESD

* MoodVectorDesign.md: this file explains how we design the mood vector

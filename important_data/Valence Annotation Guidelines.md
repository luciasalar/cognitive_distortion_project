# VALENCE ANNOTATION GUIDELINE


Lucia Chen

## Definitions 

**PRIMARY TARGET OF OPINION (PTO)**: This is the entity towards which we can determine the speaker's attitude. The entity can be a person, situation or event. *There could be more than one PTOs in one sentence or one post.*

**VALENCE** refers to the degree of positivity or negativity of the post as it relates to the primary target of opinion. 

## The Task  

In this task, you need to identify the valence of the post. Valence can be positive, negative, mixed (both positivity and negativity) or neutral. 

If the post indicates positive valence only, choose "Positive". 

If the post indicates negative valence only, choose "Negative".

If the post indicates both positive and negative valence, choose "Mixed".

If the post does not indicate any valence, choose "Neutral".

If you cannot understand the post because the languge is confusing or there's a large trunk of foreign language that you don't understand, choose "Cannot understand the post".


Valence is determined as follows: 

* If the author expresses positive or negative attitudes towards the primary target of opinion, or positive / negative emotions, then the author's attitude / emotions correspond to the valence of the post. Examples:

  * Positive: I am *very proud* / I *love* going for a walk in the rain. / I had pasta today ;) 
  * Negative: I am *so sad*. / I *hate* waking up so early this morning. / I had pasta today :(
  * Mixed: I am *so proud* to start a new chapter in my life, but *really sad* to leave my hometown. 
  * Mixed: I like the movie, but the conversation between Tom and Jack makes me feel a bit sad. 
  * Neutral: I had pasta today.

* If the author does not express any positive or negative attitude using obvious valenced words (e.g. adjectives, emoji, verbs), but the primary target of opinion has strong associations with positive or negative valence. These words usually have valence as part of their meanings, for example, *die*, *nuisance*, *disgusting* (negative) or *cherish*, *blessing*, *wonderful* (positive).  In that case, use these associations to determine valence. Consider the valence that the primary target of opinion has for most people in Western culture. 

  Don't over interpret the valence of the primary target of opinion, just go with your primary intuition. If you need a second thought to identify whether it might be positive or negative, or when there are multiple possible interpretations, label it as neutral.

  + If the primary target of opinion is usually associated with a lack of reward, threat, fear, anxiety, loss, anger, annoyance, or  other negative emotions, label the post as negative. Examples:

      * I did not win the race. (no reward)
      * My cat died. (death has strong negative associations)
      * When will politicians learn to govern? (rhetorical question indicates frustration) 
      * The wildfires have displaced thousands of people. (losing one's home is associated with negative emotions)

  + If the primary target of opinion is usually associated with a reward, success, accomplishments, or other positive emotions, label the post as positive. Examples: 

     * I finished all the assignments on time. (accomplishment)
     * I got an A on my exam. (reward)
     * My grandmother gave me a pretty necklace. (reward, indication of positive assessment of necklace)
     * We need a diplomat like him. (We can infer that the speaker has a positive attitude towards the person.)

As you have seen, valence can be represented by any word form or phrase. This includes nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and even emoticons. 

## What to do if you are not sure about the valence? 

If there are any posts where you are not sure about the correct valence, go with the option that makes the most sense to you, copy and paste the post into a separate document, and describe the reasons why you found your decision difficult. This is particularly important for the first 60 posts you label. 

## What if the post is not interpretable?
Sometimes the posts might contain one or two foreign words, but that might not affect your interpretation of the post if there's enough context information. However, sometimes the posts contain a trunk of foreign language that affects your interpretation, choose *Cannot understand the post*.

1. I was not sure how to annotate this one as there are two things the post mentions – the film and Israel-Palestine conflict – but the primary target of the opinion is the film. 

Answer: When there are two or more potential primary targets of opinion in a post, and the author expresses different attitudes towards both targets, please choose *Mixed*.

Annotation manual suggestion for Valence 

Valence derives from a person-situation relation. More precisely, it derives from a person processing a situational input. In this task, you need to identify the valence a post author ascribes to the event or the valence from the post author's emotion.

Annotation instructions
The following instructions explain the criteria you should follow when annotating valence words and phrases.


1. Valence can be expressed using any word form, including nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs and even emoticon.

2. Valence  can be expressed by just one word, but they can also span more than one word. For example:
* I am *very proud*

Read each post carefully and find all words and phrases that express positive or negative valence.
If you can only find  words and phrases that express positive valence, choose "Positive". 
If you can only find  words and phrases that express negative valence, choose "Negative".
If you can find  words and phrases that express both positive and negative valence, choose "Mixed".

Examples
* I am *delighted* with the decision to equip 150 of our stores with solar panels. (1)
* We *hate* to waste resources of any kind. (1)


If you cannot find  words and phrases that express valence, check the below principles that guide your judgement.
If the post author didn't ascribe valence to the event...

1. Does the event facilitate a goal?  (If yes, choose "Positive")

2. Does the event associate with another event with a valence representation?
For example:
'Jack didn't shower today' is likely to be associated with smell badly.

3. Does the event associated with valence representation when compared with a reference point?
For example:
A student who compares his exam score 80 out of 100 to the score of his classmates is likely to evalute it positively when his mean score of the class is 70.

4. If 1-3 don't apply, make inferences about the valence of the event based on your response to the event.


If you cannot find  words and phrases that express valence and the above principles do not applied, choose "Neutral"

Annotation manual suggestion for Valence 

Valence refers to the positivity or negativity from a person processing a situational input. Valence derives from a person-situation relation. In this task, you need to identify the valence of the post author or valence that a post author ascribes to the event.

Annotation instructions:
The following instructions explain the criteria you should follow when annotating valence.

1. Valence can be identified with valence representations:
* Valence representations can be any word form or phrases, including nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs and even emoticon.
Example: 
I am *very proud*

Note that verbs can also be representation of valence:
Example:
My goldfish *died*. 


2. If there's no obvious valence representation, pay attention to points below: 
* Negative valence is usually linked to threats (fear, anxiety), loss, nonreward.
Example:
I didn't get the first place this time. (nonreward)

* Positive valence is often reward related.
I finished all the assignments. (reward)
My grandmother gave me a pretty necklace. (reward)


* Is the event associated with valence representations when compared with a reference point?
For example:
A student who compares his exam score 80 out of 100 to the score of his classmates is likely to evalute it positively when his mean score of the class is 70.

If the above points do not apply, consider this:
* Can you make inferences about the valence of an event based on someone's response (self or others) to the event?
'Jack didn't shower today'. (Negative) 
This event is likely to induce negative response from people around the person because of the bad smell.

'He sits in a tiny box'. (Negative)
This event is likely to induce negative response from the readers because sitting in a tiny box is uncomfortable.


Now, label the posts according to the following instructions:

If the post indicates positive valence only, choose "Positive". 
If the post indicates negative valence only, choose "Negative".
If the post indicates both positive and negative valence, choose "Mixed".
If the post does not indicate any valence, choose "Neutral"

Examples
* I am *delighted* with the decision to equip 150 of our stores with solar panels. "Positive".
* We *hate* to waste resources of any kind. "Negative"

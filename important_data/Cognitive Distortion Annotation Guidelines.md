#Cognitive Distortion Annotation Guideline 

Lucia Chen

## Definitions

## The Task  


In this task, you are given posts containing negative valence only. Label whether a post shows signs of cognitive distortion. If you identify a post might indicate cognitive distortion but you are unsure which category it belongs to, put down all of those you think are most suitable to the post. 

*Cognitive distortions are systematic, a person tends to think in the same pattern across situations. We need to analyze all the posts in one user to identify if the pattern exists.* For example, if a person very rarely complains about a minor issue, it doesn’t seem to be a pattern. However, if a person complains about minor issues frequently (see the timestamp), the person has the tendency to magnify the problems he/she encounters. In other word, we need to see one user as a whole, but not just one separated post. Sometimes a sequence of posts  contains more context information. We need to consider the context information while labeling. Hence, check the timestamp and read the posts that are nearby to identify context information if necessary. 

Make sure you read all the instructions. Pay attention to the sentence highlighted. If you have doubts in labeling, read the examples carefully or contact lushi.chen@ed.ac.uk

## Checklist of Cognitive Distortions:
					

* Arbitrary Inference/Jumping to Conclusions.  Draw negative conclusion without specific evidence to support that conclusion.

	Example: She’s not answering my phone, she must be cheating on me
					
* Catastrophizing. The process of evaluating, whereby one believes the worst possible outcome will or did occur. Example: “I better not try because I might fail, and that would be awful” 
Catastrophizing thought often involves Jumping to Conclusions, The difference between Jumping to Conclusions and catastrophizing is that catastrophizing magnify the importance of minor mistakes.
	Catastrophizing has two parts: 
		Part 1: Predicting a negative outcome.
		Part 2: Jumping to the conclusion that if the negative outcome did in fact happen, it would be a catastrophe. 
	
*  Comparison. The tendency to compare oneself whereby the outcome typically results in the conclusion that one is inferior or worse off than others.

	Example: I wish I were as comfortable with women as my brother is” 

*  Dichotomous/Black-and-White Thinking. The tendency to view all experiences as fitting into one of two categories (e.g., positive or negative; good or bad) without the ability to place oneself, others, and experiences along a continuum. 

	Example 1: you might frequently flip-flop between seeing yourself as a remarkable success or a major failure based on the praise or criticism of others. 
	Example 2: A person with dichotomous thinking may meet a new coworker at work. In the beginning, the coworker is viewed as amazing, perfect, and better than any other coworker or friend ever encountered before. People with dichotomous thinking tend to have favorites and to believe that everything about a favorite person or thing is superior to others. However, as time goes on, someone with dichotomous thinking may suddenly swing to the opposite extreme. If ignored by the coworker, or if the co-worker behaves in a disappointing way, a person with dichotomous thinking may lose respect for or hate this formerly favorite coworker, unable to sustain relationships that are not distinctly "love" or "hate". 				
					
*  Disqualifying the Positive. The process of rejecting or discounting positive experiences, traits, or attributes. Denying a situation/trait/event is positive.
	Example: The imposter syndrome 

	Example: A friend compliments you on a dinner you made, but you decide that “they are just saying that to be nice” or “they are trying to get something out of me”.
						
*  Emotional Reasoning. The predominant use of an emotional state to form conclusions about oneself, others, or situations. 

	Example: “I feel terrified about going on airplanes. It must be very dangerous to fly”.

	Note: Context is very important to determine whether it’s a systematic thinking style or the person. sometimes we can’t tell whether a person has emotional reasoning from one post only. For instance, ‘I feel irritated today’. We need to examine other posts from this user, if there’s another post saying ‘I feel something bad is going to happen today, not sure why.’ Then this user has the tendency to be directed by his/her emotion, the previous post ‘I feel irritated’ could be emotional reasoning. If the previous post is ‘He cheated on me’. Then then feeling is not irrational. 

	Example 1:
	You can’t help feeling fat, though your doctor and those around you tell you that your weight lies comfortably within the normal range. You actually know this, and still…
	Example 2:
	You feel guilty about something, so you conclude you must be guilty—even though there’s absolutely no evidence that you’ve done anything wrong and others have assured you of this.
	Example 3:
	In your relationship, you struggle mightily with feelings of jealousy. You can’t resist accusing your partner of infidelity, even though they’ve shown nothing but devotion to you and you have no plausible evidence that you've been betrayed.
	Example 4:
	You feel stupid, so you’re convinced you must be dumb, regardless of the fact that your grades in school were as good as (or better than!) others and, as an adult, you’ve achieved at least as much as those around you.
	Example 5:
	You feel enraged with someone, so you take for granted that they must have done something bad, though you really can’t put your finger on anything specific and nothing about their behavior seems to provoke anyone else.
	Example 6:
	You feel lonely so you’re compelled to deduce that no one cares about you, that your feeling unequivocally confirms your unlovability.

					
* Externalization of Self-Worth. The development and maintenance of self-worth based almost exclusively on how the external world views one. Example: “My worth is dependent on what others think of me”.

	Example: If I don’t do that, people won’t like me anymore.
						
* Fortunetelling. Fortune telling is a cognitive distortion in which you predict a negative outcome without realistically considering the actual odds of that outcome. Predicting the future becomes the cognitive distortion fortune telling, when we assume that some event or events will end badly for us, that we will fail at something or we will be in danger, more as an assumption rather than an educated guess. Of course, some events do have the potential for danger, and we need to be able to assess the risk in those situations. However, fortune telling is not an accurate assessment based on evidence, it is a global assumption we make without considering the real odds.

	Example: I’ll never, ever feel better
	Example: I’m not going to get the job

Below are some different ways of thinking about fortune telling when you recognize it in your own mind:
What is the evidence for and against your prediction? It is important to examine the actual evidence, and even more importantly, the quality of that evidence. We may be able to come up with lots of reasons that support the fortune telling if we feel particularly bad about it, but would this evidence hold up in court? And consider why it would not be as convincing to someone else.

						
* Labeling. Labeling oneself using derogatory names. Labeling is a cognitive distortion in which we generalize by taking one characteristic of a person, and applying it to the whole person. Because I failed a test, I am a failure. Because she is frequently late to work, she is irresponsible.  If someone responded in a brusque way, he is a jerk. Rather than more objectively thinking about the behavior, when we engage in labeling, we globally describe the whole person.
	Example: I’m a loser.
		       She’s a failure.	
				
* Magnification. The tendency to exaggerate or magnify either the positive or negative importance or consequence of some personal trait, event, or circumstance. Giving proportionally greater weight to a perceived failure, weakness or threat, or lesser weight to a perceived success, strength or opportunity, so that the weight differs from that assigned by others, such as "making a mountain out of a molehill". Magnification is when you exaggerate the importance of your errors, fears, and imperfections.  n depressed clients, often the positive characteristics of other people are exaggerated and their negative characteristics are understated. 

	(Note: Catastrophizing is a subtype of Magnification. If a person often complain about minor issues in life, then he/she has the tendency to magnify problems)

	Example: Yon send out the wrong letter to a client at work, and this turns into “I will now lose my job, and then I won’t be able to pay my bills, and then I will lose my house.” 
							
* Mind Reading. One’s arbitrary conclusion that someone is reacting negatively, or thinking negatively toward him/her, without specific evidence to support that conclusion . 

	Example: I just know that he/she disapproves.
						
* Minimization. The process of minimizing or discounting the importance of some event, trait, or circumstance. Note: Similar to Disqualifying the Positive, minimization emphasis discounting the IMPORTANCE of something, not whether it is positive
	Example 1
	I underestimate the seriousness of situations.
	Example 2
	People who apologize for good work are almost always magnifying and minimizing. 
	Example 3
	What I say doesn’t matter anyway, I’m not important to my boss.
						
* Overgeneralization. The process of formulating rules or conclusions on the basis of limited experience and applying these rules across broad and unrelated situations. When someone over generalizes, they see that one negative event in their life as a never ending pattern. They may say or feel things like, People often feel very depressed or anxious when they feel that nothing good will ever happen. If you experience a negative incident, you believe it’s likely to happen again and again. Burns recounts a man complaining about a bird “always” defecating on his car even though it had never happened before. Using universals like “always”, “every” and “never” are common when overgeneralizing.

	Example 1:
	Why does this always happen to me?	
	Example 2:
	It doesn’t matter what my choices are, they always fall flat.
	Example 3:
	Nothing good ever happens to me.
	Example 4:
	Everything is always terrible

* Perfectionism. A constant striving to live up to some internal or external representation of perfection without examining the evidence for the reasonableness of these per- fect standards, often in an attempt to avoid a subjective experience of failure. 
	Example
	Doing a merely adequate job is akin to being a failure.
						
* Personalization. The process of assuming personal causality for situations, events, and reactions of others when there is no evidence supporting that conclusion. Personalization occurs when you assume responsibility for an external event over which you have no control. When you personalize, you feel guilty because you confuse influence with control over others. This triggers feelings of guilt and self-condemnation.
	Example: 
	My aunt said her daughter got a scholarship. She must say this to make people think that I am useless, because I didn’t get any scholarships. 
	Example: 
	My daughter failed her exam. I should have done more to help her.

						
* Selective Abstraction. The process of exclusively focusing on one negative aspect or detail of a situation, magnifying the importance of that detail, thereby casting the whole situation in a negative context. 

The difference between disqualifying of positive and selective abstraction is that the former one denies a positive event or positive trait, whereas, selective abstraction focus on negative aspects of the event

	Example:
	I hate today.
	Note: check all the posts in one user, does the user has the tendency to only focus on the negative things in a situation? We don’t know whether the person focus on one negative event in the day and then hate the whole day. We need to see if selective abstraction occurs in other posts as well.
						
* “Should” Statements. A pattern of internal expectations or demands on oneself, without examination of the reasonableness of these expectations in the context of one’s life, abilities, and other resources. 

	Example: 
	I shouldn’t have made so many mistakes

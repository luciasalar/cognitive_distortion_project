#Cognitive Distortion Annotation Guideline 

Lucia Chen

## Definitions

## The Task  


In this task, you are given posts containing negative valence only. Label whether a post shows signs of cognitive distortion. If you identify a post might indicate cognitive distortion but you are unsure which category it belongs to, put down all of those you think are most suitable to the post. For post you are unsure, select unsure in the second box.

*Cognitive distortions are systematic, a person might think in the same pattern across situations. However, social media text does not reveal all the thoughts of a person, we are not able to identify if there is a pattern exist most of the time. In this case, we can only flag posts that might reflect cognitive distortion.* 

*Sometimes it's difficult for us to judge whether the statement is true to the reality based on one Facebook post only. You may read through nearby posts to find contextual information. If contextual information can't be identified and if the author did not provide evidence in the text, we flag the post as cognitive distortion.*

	For example:
	I'm so fat, I shouldn't eat so much.
	I know she doesn't like me.

Remember: The goal of this task is to identify signs of cognitive distortion. The above text may or may not true to the reality, we should annotate them as cognitive distortion, but also select *unsure*.


Make sure you read all the instructions. Pay attention to the sentence highlighted. If you have doubts in labeling, read the examples carefully or contact lushi.chen@ed.ac.uk

## Checklist of Cognitive Distortions:
					

* **Jumping to Conclusions**. Draw negative conclusion without evidence to support that conclusion.

   
	Example: 
	- She’s not answering my phone, she must be cheating on me.
	
					
* **Catastrophizing**. One believes the worst situation will occur.

    
    Example: 
 	- I better not try because I might fail, and that would be awful.
 	

*Difference between Jumping to Conclusions and Catastrophizing: 
Catastrophizing thought often involves Jumping to Conclusions, catastrophizing magnify the importance of minor mistakes.*
	
	
*  **Comparison** One beliefs that he/she is worse than others because one tend to compare himself/herself with others

   
	Example: 
	- I wish I were as comfortable with women as my brother is.
	

*  **Dichotomous/Black-and-White Thinking** The tendency to view all experiences as fitting into one of two categories (e.g., positive or negative; good or bad).

	
	Example:
	- you might frequently flip-flop between seeing yourself as a remarkable success or a major failure based on the praise or criticism of others. 

	- A person with dichotomous thinking may meet a new coworker at work. In the beginning, the coworker is viewed as amazing, perfect, and better than any other coworker or friend ever encountered before. People with dichotomous thinking tend to have favorites and to believe that everything about a favorite person or thing is superior to others. However, as time goes on, someone with dichotomous thinking may suddenly swing to the opposite extreme. If ignored by the coworker, or if the co-worker behaves in a disappointing way, a person with dichotomous thinking may lose respect for or hate this formerly favorite coworker, unable to sustain relationships that are not distinctly "love" or "hate". 		
		
					
*  **Disqualifying the Positive** Denying a situation/trait/event is positive.
	
	Example: 
	- The imposter syndrome 

	- A friend compliments you on a dinner you made, but you decide that “they are just saying that to be nice” or “they are trying to get something out of me”.
						
*  **Emotional Reasoning** Letting your emotions to direct your conclusions about yourself, others, or situations. 


	Example:
	- You can’t help feeling fat, though your doctor and those around you tell you that your weight lies comfortably within the normal range. You actually know this, and still…

	- You feel guilty about something, so you conclude you must be guilty—even though there’s absolutely no evidence that you’ve done anything wrong and others have assured you of this.

	- In your relationship, you struggle mightily with feelings of jealousy. You can’t resist accusing your partner of infidelity, even though they’ve shown nothing but devotion to you and you have no plausible evidence that you've been betrayed.

	- You feel stupid, so you’re convinced you must be dumb, regardless of the fact that your grades in school were as good as (or better than!) others and, as an adult, you’ve achieved at least as much as those around you.

	- You feel enraged with someone, so you take for granted that they must have done something bad, though you really can’t put your finger on anything specific and nothing about their behavior seems to provoke anyone else.

	- You feel lonely so you’re compelled to deduce that no one cares about you, that your feeling unequivocally confirms your unlovability.

					
* **Externalization of Self-Worth** Develop one's self-worth only based on how the external world views one.

	Example: 
	- My worth is dependent on what others think of me.

	- If I don’t do that, people won’t like me anymore.
						
* **Fortunetelling**  Assume that some event or events will end badly for us, that we will fail at something or we will be in danger, more as an assumption rather than an educated guess. *Sometimes it's difficult for us to judge whether the statement is supported by evidence or not based on Facebook text only. In this case, if the author did not provide evidence in the text, we flag the post as cognitive distortion*

	Example: 
	- I’ll never, ever feel better.

	- I’m not going to get the job.

						
* **Labeling** Labeling oneself or others using derogatory names.

	Example: 
	- I’m a loser.
	- I failed a test, I am a failure.	
	- she is frequently late to work, she is irresponsible. 
				
* **Magnification** Exaggerate the importance of your errors, fears, and imperfections. 

	Example: 
	- Yon send out the wrong letter to a client at work, and this turns into “I will now lose my job, and then I won’t be able to pay my bills, and then I will lose my house.” 

*Note: Catastrophizing is a subtype of Magnification.*
							
* **Mind Reading** Concluding that other people are reacting negatively, or thinking negatively toward him/her, without evidence to support the conclusion. 

	Example: 
	- I just know that he/she will disapprove.

*Sometimes it's difficult for us to judge whether the statement is true to the reality based on Facebook text only. In this case, if the author did not provide evidence in the text, we flag the post as cognitive distortion*
						
* **Minimization** Minimizing or discounting the importance of some event, trait, or circumstance. Note: Similar to Disqualifying the Positive, minimization emphasis discounting the IMPORTANCE of something, not whether it is positive
	
	Example: 
	- People tell you that you have done a good job but you are still anxious that it's not good enough
	- What I say doesn’t matter anyway, my opinion is not important to the group.
						
* **Overgeneralization** When someone over generalizes, they see that one negative event in their life as a never ending pattern. People with overgeneralization thinking patterns tend to use “always”, “every” and “never” very often.

	Example :
	- Why does this always happen to me?	

	- It doesn’t matter what my choices are, they always fall flat.

	- Nothing good ever happens to me.
	
	- Everything is always terrible.

* **Perfectionism** Constantly striving to live up to some internal or external standards of perfection without evalutating whether the goal is realistic or not.

	Example: 
	- Doing a merely adequate job is just a failure.
						
* **Personalization** Assume you are responsible for an external event over which you have no control. When you personalize, you feel guilty because you confuse influence with control over others. 

	Example: 
	- My daughter failed her exam. I should have done more to help her.

						
* **Selective Abstraction** The process of exclusively focusing on one negative aspect or detail of a situation, magnifying the importance of that detail, thereby casting the whole situation in a negative context. 

	Example:
	- I hate school.
	
	*We don't know what happen to this person in school, but usually there are ups and downs. Some people often assign positive meanings to daily life events, whereas, some people magnify the negativity of one event.*
	
	*Note: The difference between disqualifying of positive and selective abstraction is that the former one denies a positive event or positive trait, whereas, selective abstraction focus on negative aspects of the event*
						
* **“Should” Statements** A pattern of having internal expectations or demands on oneself, without whether it's reasonable to have these expectations or not.

	Example: 
	- I shouldn’t have made so many mistakes.

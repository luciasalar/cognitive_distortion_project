#Research Questions:

# RQ1: Can social media data reflect mood alternations that contribute to mental health vulnerability? 


# RQ2: What type of cognitive distortions can be inferred from social media data?

This project contains 4 folders:

1. scripts 
2. important data
3. paper
4. prediction model

MARIA: It also contains a data folder. What is in the data folder, where does it come from 


1. scripts
data selection process: 

1) cleaned_data.rmd : this script matched users who finished CESD, Big5, SWL and Schwartz value scale. It generates user_scale_post_time2.csv (333 users, remove users who didnâ€™t complete all the items in CESD, we have 301 users )

2) sampling_strategy.rmd: sampling strategy that identify 90 users, generates users_to_be_analysed.csv

3) 60d_beforeCESD.R: select posts that are posted 60 days before they (90 users) completed CESD (4362 posts), generates two_months.csv

basic_stats.rmd: analyse correlation between the negative disortion / negative emotion score and SWL, CESD, BIG5  (this is the script that generate the results we reported on the paper)

mergelabeleddata.R: a template to merge labeled data with scales

self-disclosure:machine label of self-disclosure level

text_label.py: count word frequency and bigram 

2. important data

resample_5000.csv: file with labels

user_scale_post_time2.csv: scale values, posts, demographic information of 301 users.

two_months.csv: file generated by 60d_beforeCESD.R, user posts (60 days before users fill out CESD)

users_to_be_analysed.csv: regular posters who have at least one post after they fill out CESD

3. paper
haven't uploaded it yet

4. prediction model
prediction models on negative emotion and cognitive distortion


-----------
information for sampling:

Regular users (122): post more than 0.3 post everyday.  30 day: 2331, 60 day: 4696, all posts: 48997, select post count > 20, 60 day (4362)
All users (301):30 day: 3007 , 60day: 6071, all posts: 64164
Regular users whose last post is less than a week before their CES-D posts (90):
30day : 2280,  60days: 4502,  select post count > 20, 60 day (4265)


The sample we used for labelling contains 4154 users, duplicated or empty posts were removed
MARIA: Is that posts or users?
